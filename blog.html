                            <b>How to use Git</b>
                            <p>
                                When you start with Git and GitHub you will hear a term being used constantly, i.e. version control.Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake, while minimizing disruption to the workflow.Git is a distributed version control system. That means your local clone of the project is a complete version control repository. So, this type of repo can be used offline or remotely. In simple words you can work locally on your system, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code. This gives added benefit, i.e. you can work in a team remotely too, where everyone has their own local copy of code and can work simultaneously on their own branches.

                            <b>Git Terminology</b>
                            <b>1. Repository</b>
                            <p>A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They can be imagined as a project’s folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file’s revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can either be public or private.</p>
                            <b>2. Clone</b>
                            <p>A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website’s server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online.</p>
                            <b>3. Fork</b>
                            <p>A fork is a personal copy of another user’s repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.</p>
                            <b>4. Pull</b>
                            <p>Pull refers to when you are fetching changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you’re both working on, you’ll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it’s up to date.</p>
                            <b>5. Push</b>
                            <p>To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.</p>
